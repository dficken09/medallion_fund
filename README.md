# medallion_fund

This is the github folder for the website https://drewficken-medallion-fund.shinyapps.io/app_files/

The app is created using the app.R script. Functions and data curation techniques can be found in the other *.R scripts. 

The files that don't have a file type listed are RDS files which can only be used with R. They are used to store a single object and are great for storing strange types of objects (list of lists, regression outputs, etc.). They also help limit the memory usage.
